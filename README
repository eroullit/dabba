What is dabba?
====================

dabba is a set of network tools written in C for Linux.

Its main use is to gather or scatter actions on a network such as
traffic capture, traffic replay or traffic generation on a network.

This is inspired on the Dabba Walla system present in Mumbai where
meals are regrouped and dispatched throughout the city with a
high efficency rate, every day of the year.

What is libdabba's goal?
====================

libdabba's goal is to prepare a clear and simple API for future networking tools.

Those then can be for high performance network tooling which
focus on usability, robustness and functionality. Its aim is to support
the daily work for networking engineers, developers, admins or Linux
users by providing support with or in network monitoring, protocol
analysis, reverse engineering, network debugging and penetration testing.


What is a zero-copy * ring?
==========================

Zero-copy rings are memory-mapped ring buffers common to kernelspace and userspace where
packets can be directly read or written.
This direct way drastically reduces the processing overhead as packets are not hard-copied
between spaces.
When using a RX ring, received packets are quicker available to the userspace.
When a TX ring is used, packets to transmit can be placed to medium within shorter time.

What is a PCAP file?
====================

A PCAP file is a file where previously recorded packets are saved.
It can be then read to perform protocol analysis, reverse engineering or network debugging.
dabba will stay independant of libpcap, but nevertheless offer PCAP file support
to capture, replay and perform offline analysis on recorded traffic.

Some use cases and features
===========================

* Open source project and free licensing
* Analyzing and debugging of network problems or protocol implementations
* Reverse engineering of (proprietary) network protocols
* Dumping, replaying and offline analysis of pcap traces
* Integrated high performance capabilities
* Focus on usability, robustness, security and functionality

Development
===========

There's a public Git repository at http://github.com/eroullit/dabba
where you can check out the latest code base.

git clone git://github.com/eroullit/dabba.git

Coding conventions can be found in CODING.

Installalation
==============

You need to fulfill these prerequisites in order to build dabba:
	- Linux kernel >= 2.6.31
	- cmake
	- setcap (within libcap package)

To build out-of-tree:
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make
	# make install

Some unit tests need the following extra capabilities:
	- CAP_NET_ADMIN - To allow various network-related operations
	- CAP_NET_RAW - To allow use of RAW and PACKET sockets.

To grant them run in your build directory:
	# make setcap
