What is dabba?
==============

dabba is a set of network tools written for Linux.

The project has 4 main components:
    - libdabba - low-level zero-copy network library
    - libdabba-rpc - protobuf-based rpc library for dabbad and dabba
    - dabbad - multi-threaded task manager and RPC query processor
    - dabba - CLI 'à la git' to communicate with dabbad and submit tasks

Currently supported feature are listed in the CODING file.

Get the source!
===============

There's a public Git repository at http://github.com/eroullit/dabba
where you can check out the latest code base.

git clone git://github.com/eroullit/dabba.git

Contributions are welcome, CODING regroups all information about it.

Prerequisites
=============

dabba needs these to compile and run properly:
	- Linux kernel >= 2.6.31
	- build-essential
	- cmake
	- pthread
	- libnl-3-dev
	- libnl-genl-3-dev
	- libnl-route-3-dev
	- protobuf-c-compiler
	- libprotobuf-c0-dev
	- setcap (within libcap2-bin package)

Recommended optional packages:
	- python-yaml
	- doxygen

Installation
============

To build out-of-tree:
	$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

To install it after being built:
	$ sudo make install/strip

Capabilities
============

To configure dabba to run with a regular user account:
	$ sudo make setcap

Testing
=======

Automatic tests are available. There are two kinds:
	- Read-only (which do not interfere with network interface settings)
	- Read-write (which modify network interface settings)

WARNING: Read-write tests might degrade or disable the
interface connectivity while tests are running. Avoid to run
then on production interfaces.

To run read-only automatic tests, make sure proper capabilities are granted and
run in the build directory:
	$ ctest --output-on-failure

To run read-only automatic tests, make sure proper capabilities are granted,
set the `TEST_DEV` variable with the interface name to modify
and run in the build directory:
	$ TEST_DEV=eth0 ctest --output-on-failure

Getting started!
================

Start dabbad:
	$ dabbad --daemonize

As long as dabbad is running, captures tasks can be submitted:
	$ dabba capture start --interface eth0 --pcap /tmp/example.pcap

Running captures can be listed in YAML format:
	$ dabba capture get
	---
	  captures:
	    - id: 3076324160
	      rc: 0 # Success
	      packet mmap size: 32768
	      frame number: 16
	      pcap: /tmp/example.pcap
	      interface: eth0

Stopping the capture:
	$ dabba capture stop --id 3076324160
