Feature implementation
======================

Each feature will developed in its own branch.

Its implementation must follow this order:
 - Coding the actual implementation
 - Coding test cases which will cover this specific feature
 - Doxygen based documentation

After the feature is stabilized, it will merged back on the master branch.
Each feature will bring its own set of test cases to check the stability
status and to provide a quick way to perform regression tests.

When the desired set of feature a implemented and merged back to the master
branch, a tag will be created which can be then released.

Coding style
============

C source code and header file must be indent using
indent -linux

Resources
=========

The whole project management will be based on GitHub.
It regroups wiki, ticket system, code review and
statistics.

A mirror of the project can be found on repo.or.cz.
